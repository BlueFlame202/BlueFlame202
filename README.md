## About Me 🌊 

I'm Aathreya. I like to code for two reasons:
1. 📊 I like modeling phenomena with math, code gives me the ability to make some of that theory tangible.
2. 🏃‍♂️ I like trying to optimize things, and code is one of those things where there is a lot to be optimized. On that note, I love building (or trying to build) game engines.

Contact me if you'd like to learn more about the types of problems I'm currently working on solving! 😁

## Skills 🧰 

I'm able to pick up and work in most object-oriented programming languages. My favorite languages are <span style="color:blue">C++</span> (for speed and beauty), <span style="color:blue">Python</span> (for ease of use and widespread acceptance), and <span style="color:blue">Java</span> (for cross-platform and OOP). I'm also familiar with web programming and the related languages and principles, although this isn't an area I have as much expertise in. I used <span style="color:blue">Next.js</span> to build my website/blog.

For games, I generally use <span style="color:blue">OpenGL/GLM/GLEW/GLFW</span>. For manipulating tensors and ML, I have worked with both <span style="color:blue">Pytorch</span> and <span style="color:blue">Tensorflow/Keras</span>. I am familiar with <span style="color:blue">Pandas/Scipy</span> for basic data manipulation and other ML things. Recently, I've been learning <span style="color:blue">FEniCSx</span> (a software for using FEM to solve PDEs).

Some other notable things I like using include <span style="color:blue">Numpy</span> for super fast math in <span style="color:blue">Python</span>, <span style="color:blue">OpenCV</span> for generic image processing, <span style="color:blue">PyMuPDF</span> for parsing PDFs, <span style="color:blue">HuggingFace</span> and <span style="color:blue">NLTK</span> for language modeling, and <span style="color:blue">BeautifulSoup/Selenium</span> for scraping.
