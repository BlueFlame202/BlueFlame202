## About Me üåä 

I'm Aathreya. I like to code for two reasons:
1. üìä Making mathematical models more tangible.
2. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I like optimizing things.

## Projects üå± 

Here are some projects I've worked on. To navigate to the repository for the project, click on the "Teleport" link at the end of the description.

**algae:** Implementations of various algorithms I learned in my algorithms course. This way, I can use them easily in C++. <a href="https://github.com/BlueFlame202/algae">Teleport.</a>

**darth-vader-py:** The VADER method has some issues, which I documented in my repositories. I countered these issues by allowing for a more dynamic lexicon that isn't necessarily gold-standard, but is more accurate when it comes to sentiment. This way, it was more useful and sensitive for certain corpus of tweets that I cared about. <a href="https://github.com/BlueFlame202/darth-vader-py">Teleport.</a>

**vader-cpp:** A C++ version of the VADER sentiment analysis tool. I made this so I could do sentiment analysis on a large corpus much faster, and also just because I like C++ and there wasn't an existing repository implementing this. I wrote this a while ago, so in hindsight, some things could be changed (especially stylistically). When I get a chance I'll make updates. If you would like to see these updates made, shoot me an email at aathreyakadambi@gmail.com so I'll prioritize them! <a href="https://github.com/BlueFlame202/vader-cpp">Teleport.</a>

**latex-and-asy:** The files I use to make my fancy LaTeX notes and documents. <a href="https://github.com/BlueFlame202/latex-and-asy">Teleport.</a>

**blueflame202.github.io:** The public side of my website/blog. <a href="https://github.com/BlueFlame202/blueflame202.github.io">Teleport.</a>

### High School (AKA: Bad Code But In Good Spirit)

Ahh... back then I was just learning to code! Hahaha, these projects were some of the projects that got me into coding. I also didn't know Git, so I mainly used Github desktop (and it didn't work so well for me). In fact, a traumatizing moment for me was when I used Git to delete my entire graphics engine project (maybe the fifth one I had built and the first one to actually "work") in a way that was irrecoverable. Even though they can be a bit bad in hindsight, I still love these projects. üòÅ I think my favorite ones were Spectroscopy, CQuMuG-Base, and School.

- **E-Spectrometry:** A C++ version of my Java Spectroscopy project, where I averaged over videos of iPhone-captured spectra. The goal of this was to try and get more accurate measurements. <a href="https://github.com/BlueFlame202/E-Spectrometry">Teleport.</a>
- **E:** Experimenting with OpenCV in C++ with the goal of, eventually, building a security system for my house. I think I might return to this project since I know a lot more about it now. This project though, **E**, was supposed to be a generic tool for image stuff. <a href="https://github.com/BlueFlame202/E">Teleport.</a>
- **School:** I happened to have a cool substitute teacher, and she taught us this cool stuff from her classes at Princeton. As such, some of the projects from a certain class in Princeton are implemented here, along with a maze game I made in Java. <a href="https://github.com/BlueFlame202/School">Teleport.</a>
- **CQuMuG-Base**: The project that originally got deleted. This was my project to have a quick and multipurpose graphics rendering tool, for example for highly customizable 3D geometry explorations, data visualization, or rendering terrain. <a href="https://github.com/BlueFlame202/CQuMuG-Base">Teleport.</a>
- **CsoulUI:** Console user interface, it's essentially what it sounds like, built for programs in C++. That way, I could have simple console-based UIs for future console applications I built in C++. <a href="https://github.com/BlueFlame202/CsoulUI">Teleport.</a>
- **koolCard:** A project for an older version of my blog, it's a rotating card that can display an image of your choice, built in WebGL. <a href="https://github.com/BlueFlame202/koolCard">Teleport.</a>
- **Spectroscopy:** One of my favorite projects, I used my phone and a diffraction grating + cereal box to capture the spectra of various light sources, and then tried to standardize the images for study via basic image processing methods. I was also trying to resolve the Fraunhofer lines digitally, which didn't end up working, but in the process, I still managed to find the spectra of things like light bulbs and chlorophyll I extracted. <a href="https://github.com/BlueFlame202/Spectroscopy">Teleport.</a>
- **AI:** Another original attempt at some AI stuff. I thought: hey, we have CPUs and GPUs, and I think I had recently heard of some mystical thing called an ALU. This sounded fancy to me, so I made "Artificial Language Unit" and "Artificial Intelligence Unit", and to be honest I don't know how I was thinking of organizing it. But this attempt was much cooler than the first; I tried to form relationships between words based on dictionary definitions. I stored the details of a word in something I made called a **Word Information Packet (WIP)**, basically a structure containing the word, a list of definitions, a list of parts of speeches, the plural form of the word, and another string for any additional information. I then did some cool manipulations with this, tried out some naive ideas for sentiment analysis, and did other things. I was really proud of this after I found out about NLTK and Wordnet. <a href="https://github.com/BlueFlame202/AI">Teleport.</a>
- **Data-Encription:** It's pretty funny I spelled this wrong. This thing just encrypts and decrypts messages. It generates a random key, and it also places the key in the message. Only people who know the format of the message can decipher it. I've always enjoyed making breakable codes. <a href="https://github.com/BlueFlame202/Data-Encription">Teleport.</a>
- **Associative-Memory:** Back when I started to code, I was obsessed with this idea that I could have a bot that could learn English. I naively made a strvector class (string-based vectors). To be honest, I don't remember why I did that, but I was very proud of it at the time. I think the other thing that was notable was in read.h, where I was using various string manipulations and trying to discover relationships between words in sentences. Overall, I'm proud of my younger self for trying my own original approach to this problem. <a href="https://github.com/BlueFlame202/Associative-Memory">Teleport.</a>


<!-- Commented out bc I felt like my profile was too resume-like. I feel like you can see what types of things I use by looking at my code.
## Skills üß∞ 

I'm able to pick up and work in most object-oriented programming languages. My favorite languages are **C++** (for speed and beauty), **Python** (for ease of use and widespread acceptance), and **Java** (for cross-platform and OOP). I'm also familiar with web programming and the related languages and principles, although this isn't an area I have as much expertise in. I used **Next.js** to build my website/blog.

For games, I generally use **OpenGL/GLM/GLEW/GLFW**. For manipulating tensors and ML, I have worked with both **Pytorch** and **Tensorflow/Keras**. I am familiar with **Pandas/Scipy** for basic data manipulation and other ML things. Recently, I've been learning **FEniCSx** (a software for using FEM to solve PDEs).

Some other notable things I like using include **NumPy** for super fast math in **Python**, **OpenCV** for generic image processing, **PyMuPDF** for parsing PDFs, **HuggingFace** and **NLTK** for language modeling, and **BeautifulSoup/Selenium** for scraping.
