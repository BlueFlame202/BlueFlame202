## About Me 🌊 

I'm Aathreya. I like to code for two reasons:
1. 📊 I like modeling phenomena with math, code gives me the ability to make some of that theory tangible.
2. 🏃‍♂️ I like trying to optimize things, and code is one of those things where there is a lot to be optimized. On that note, I love building (or trying to build) game engines.

Contact me if you'd like to learn more about the types of problems I'm currently working on solving! 😁

## Skills 🧰 

I'm able to pick up and work in most object-oriented programming languages. My favorite languages are **C++** (for speed and beauty), **Python** (for ease of use and widespread acceptance), and **Java** (for cross-platform and OOP). I'm also familiar with web programming and the related languages and principles, although this isn't an area I have as much expertise in. I used **Next.js** to build my website/blog.

For games, I generally use **OpenGL/GLM/GLEW/GLFW**. For manipulating tensors and ML, I have worked with both **Pytorch** and **Tensorflow/Keras**. I am familiar with **Pandas/Scipy** for basic data manipulation and other ML things. Recently, I've been learning **FEniCSx** (a software for using FEM to solve PDEs).

Some other notable things I like using include **NumPy** for super fast math in **Python**, **OpenCV** for generic image processing, **PyMuPDF** for parsing PDFs, **HuggingFace** and **NLTK** for language modeling, and **BeautifulSoup/Selenium** for scraping.
